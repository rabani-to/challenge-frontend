# Radish Frontend Challenge

The following file describes a Development Challenge to help on testing Frontend-related skills in Web3 areas for future [Radishers <sup>1</sup>](https://github.com/rabani-to/challenge-frontend#notes).

## Abstract

With the current state of the Web, Frontend Developers need to handle a huge-unpredictable amount of local state when crafting Software.

Since JAMStack revolution we’ve being serving content directly to clients. In Web3 you need to add the learning curve of wallets, transactions, unpredictable gas errors, and trying to understand why the poor Solana is going that low : (

Take the following challenge like a little-yet-open to awesomeness entry point for developers to show off the world their Web3-ish skills!

## The Challenge

Your goal is to create a platform with at least 2(`ETH, USDC or DAI`) AAVE/Compound asset pools, where users can approve a deposit, to lastly add its available balance to a pool.

**Suggested Stack:** TypeScript, NextJS, TailwindCSS & Wagmi/Rainbowkit.

## What we expect the app to do

- Users can connect/disconnect using their wallet (We suggest using Rainbowkit)
- Users can see a list of pools they can deposit assets to
- Users can approve the deposit of assets for a specific pool (see https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612)
- I can see the APY for the list of pools
- I can see my available balance to deposit in a pool
- I can see my supplied balance in both token units and USD to a pool

## Hey, that's not rocket science

🧐 We do know this will be easy for you… so, to make the app even cooler for users you can pick one, or two of these:

- As a user, I can see my possible earnings based on the APY (see https://governance.aave.com/t/how-is-the-amount-of-interest-determined-when-withdrawing/11221)
- As a user, I can withdraw assets from pools I’ve deposited assets to
- Users can see a summary of their pools, like earnings, deposited balance, or suggest new pools.
- Add the “Add token to wallet” option, so I can track the pool token within my wallet UI

## What we expect from you

We’ll deep dive into the way you solve problems, and expect a clean, good code. I’ll be watching your git history 👀.

The core of this challenge is to understand how you handle to create a software with the guide of the all mighty google and AAVE/Compound docs. Apart from that, we expect you consider the Distributed System trickery needed when building software for The Space, things like, wrong states, remote state sync and ultimately, how you output that information to end users.

We won't accept `code only` solutions, we expect your challenge to be served in a live URL. To serve your app, use Vercel, Netlify or Github/Gitlab Pages.

👩‍🚀 Put references to the codebase in your App Footer or anywhere you'll like to.


## Sending your solution

You can apply even if the position is still not available at Linkedin or Angel.co, please note that we do NOT want you to make this challenge just for the sake of doing a `“job application”`. Make it your portfolio, apply to a grant, or elaborate a new product for The Space 🥰.

Use this form for sending your solution, https://airtable.com/shr6daSdtLc6183ld, and remember you’ll only have 3 days to finish.

***Note:** You can choose any network, be it mainnet or testent. Build the app your way!*
