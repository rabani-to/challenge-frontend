# Radish Frontend Challenge

The following describes a development challenge to help test Frontend related skills in Web3 areas for [Radishers <sup>1</sup>](https://github.com/rabani-to/challenge-frontend#notes).

## Abstract

Frontend Developers nowadays need to handle a huge-unpredictable amount of local app flow.

Since JAM Stack revolution we’ve being serving content directly to clients, in Web3 you need to add the learning curve of wallets, transactions and understanding why the poor Solana is so down : (

We’re creating this little-yet open to awesomeness frontend challenge to show off the world your web3-ish skills!

## The Challenge

Your goal as a Frontend developer is to list at least 2(ETH, USDC, DAI) AAVE or Compound Asset pools, and allow users to approve a deposit, so they can add some liquidity.

## What we expect the app to do

- Users can connect using their wallet (We suggest using Rainbowkit)
- Users can see a list of pools they can deposit assets to
- Users can approve the deposit of assets for a specific pool (see https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612)
- I can see the APY for the list of pools
- I can see my available balance to deposit
- I can see my supplied balance in both token units and USD

## Hey, that's not rocket science

We do know this will be easy for you… so, to level this up you can add your custom taste to this challenge, you can add one, two, or three of these:

- As a user, I can see my possible earnings based on the APY (see https://governance.aave.com/t/how-is-the-amount-of-interest-determined-when-withdrawing/11221)
- As a user, I can withdraw assets from pools I’ve deposited assets to
- Users can withdraw their assets from a pool
- Add an “Add token to wallet” option, so I can track my token within my wallet UI

## What we expect from you

We’ll dive into the way you solve problems, and expect a clean, good code. We’ be watching your git history : ).
The core of this challenge is to understand how you handle to create a software with the guide of the all mighty google and docs.

Apart from that, we expect you consider Distributed System trickery needed in distributed software, possible wrong states. Remote state sync and how you can output that to the user, so it understands what’s happening.

We expect your challenge to be served in a live URL. You can use Vercel, Netlify, Github/Gitlab Pages to do so.

## Sending your solution

You can apply even if the position is still not available at Linkedin or Angel.co, please note that we do NOT want to make this challenge just for the sake of doing a “job application”.

Use this form for sending your solution, https://airtable.com/shr6daSdtLc6183ld, and remember you’ll only have 3 days to finish.
